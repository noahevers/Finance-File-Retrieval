To reproduce the results, please download the FinanceBench dataset from https://github.com/patronus-ai/financebench and put it into a folder called 'data' at the same level as this notebook. Additionally, you will have to download each document from the FinanceBench dataset. You should be able to recover 80 of the documents. From there, the code should run as expected. The results should be similar although not exactly the same given the stochasticity of LLMs.

The code focuses on retrieval and does not include any of the generative element of RAG. In the first part of the code that focuses on evaluating RAG vs. an unrealistic Oracle setting, the retrieved evidence chunks were manually fed into ChatGPT as is described in the paper.
