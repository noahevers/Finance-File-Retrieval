OUR BUSINESS Executive Overview PepsiCo is a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands , including Lay ’ s , Doritos , Cheetos , Gatorade , Pepsi-Cola , Mountain Dew , Quaker and SodaStream . Through our operations , authorized bottlers , contract manufacturers and other third parties , we make , market , distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods , serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories . As a global company with deep local ties , we faced many of the same challenges in 2022 as our consumers , customers , and competitors across the world , including supply chain disruptions ; inflationary pressures ; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors ; another year of the COVID-19 pandemic ; a worsening climate crisis ; a highly competitive operating environment ; a rapidly changing retail landscape , including the growth in e-commerce ; continued macroeconomic and political volatility , including the deadly conflict in Ukraine ; and an evolving regulatory landscape . To meet the challenges of today – and those of tomorrow – we are driven by an approach called pep+ ( PepsiCo Positive ) . pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business , with sustainability and human capital at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people . pep+ guides how we are working to transform our business operations , from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way , to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet . pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars , bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals under a comprehensive framework : • Positive Agriculture : We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the earth across seven million acres of land , an area approximately equal to our entire agricultural footprint , sustainably source key crops and ingredients , and improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain . In 2022 , we elevated a number of external strategic partnerships and key engagements with this focus , including a partnership with Archer Daniels Midland Company ( ADM ) to scale regenerative agriculture across our shared supply chains , up to 2 million acres ; a research agreement with MIT to develop a more precise measurement of the greenhouse gas impact of regenerative agriculture practices ; a strategic engagement with Corteva focused on agriculture sustainability , new substrates , and affordability in food corn and vegetable oils ; and a joint effort with a start-up called N-Drip to scale advantaged micro irrigation technology that can provide water-saving , crop-enhancing benefits to farmers around the world . 30 Table of Contents • Positive Value Chain : We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to : achieve net-zero emissions by 2040 ; become net water positive by 2030 ; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain . Our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving , using more recycled content in our plastic packaging , and scaling our SodaStream business globally , potentially eliminating the need for more than 200 billion plastic bottles by 2030 . In 2022 , we also announced a new global packaging goal intended to double the percentage of all beverage servings delivered through reusable models from 10 % to 20 % by 2030 . Additionally , we are making progress on our diversity , equity and inclusion journey around the world . And we continue to empower each one of our approximately 315,000 employees to make a positive impact in their communities through our\n",

OUR BUSINESS Executive Overview PepsiCo is a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands , including Lay ’ s , Doritos , Cheetos , Gatorade , Pepsi-Cola , Mountain Dew , Quaker and SodaStream . Through our operations , authorized bottlers , contract manufacturers and other third parties , we make , market , distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods , serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories . As a global company with deep local ties , we faced many of the same challenges in 2022 as our consumers , customers , and competitors across the world , including supply chain disruptions ; inflationary pressures ; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors ; another year of the COVID-19 pandemic ; a worsening climate crisis ; a highly competitive operating environment ; a rapidly changing retail landscape , including the growth in e-commerce ; continued macroeconomic and political volatility , including the deadly conflict in Ukraine ; and an evolving regulatory landscape . To meet the challenges of today – and those of tomorrow – we are driven by an approach called pep+ ( PepsiCo Positive ) . pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business , with sustainability and human capital at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people . pep+ guides how we are working to transform our business operations , from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way , to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet . pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars , bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals under a comprehensive framework : • Positive Agriculture : We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the earth across seven million acres of land , an area approximately equal to our entire agricultural footprint , sustainably source key crops and ingredients , and improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain . In 2022 , we elevated a number of external strategic partnerships and key engagements with this focus , including a partnership with Archer Daniels Midland Company ( ADM ) to scale regenerative agriculture across our shared supply chains , up to 2 million acres ; a research agreement with MIT to develop a more precise measurement of the greenhouse gas impact of regenerative agriculture practices ; a strategic engagement with Corteva focused on agriculture sustainability , new substrates , and affordability in food corn and vegetable oils ; and a joint effort with a start-up called N-Drip to scale advantaged micro irrigation technology that can provide water-saving , crop-enhancing benefits to farmers around the world . 30 Table of Contents • Positive Value Chain : We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to : achieve net-zero emissions by 2040 ; become net water positive by 2030 ; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain . Our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving , using more recycled content in our plastic packaging , and scaling our SodaStream business globally , potentially eliminating the need for more than 200 billion plastic bottles by 2030 . In 2022 , we also announced a new global packaging goal intended to double the percentage of all beverage servings delivered through reusable models from 10 % to 20 % by 2030 . Additionally , we are making progress on our diversity , equity and inclusion journey around the world . And we continue to empower each one of our approximately 315,000 employees to make a positive impact in their communities through our\n",

See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements . 65 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo , Inc. and the affiliates that we control . In addition , we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest , our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources . We do not control these other affiliates , as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50 % or less . Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated . As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions , we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries . As such , our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented . Raw materials , direct labor and plant overhead , as well as purchasing and receiving costs , costs directly related to production planning , inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities , are included in cost of sales . The costs of moving , storing and delivering finished product , including merchandising activities , are included in selling , general and administrative expenses . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenues , expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities . Estimates are used in determining , among other items , sales incentives accruals , tax reserves , share-based compensation , pension and retiree medical accruals , amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite- lived intangible assets , goodwill and other long-lived assets . We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience , as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances , such as current economic conditions , and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change . Additionally , the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate . As future events and their effect can not be determined with precision , actual results could differ significantly from those estimates . Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December , resulting in a 53 reporting week every five or six years , including in our 2022 financial results . While our North America financial results are reported on a weekly calendar basis , substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021 . Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 , all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis . This change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements . The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for 2022 , reflecting the additional week in the fourth quarter : rd Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter United States and Canada 12 weeks 12 weeks 12 weeks 17 weeks International January , February March , April and May June , July and August September , October , November and December Unless otherwise noted , tabular dollars are in millions , except per share amounts .

OUR BUSINESS Executive Overview PepsiCo is a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands , including Lay ’ s , Doritos , Cheetos , Gatorade , Pepsi-Cola , Mountain Dew , Quaker and SodaStream . Through our operations , authorized bottlers , contract manufacturers and other third parties , we make , market , distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods , serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories . As a global company with deep local ties , we faced many of the same challenges in 2022 as our consumers , customers , and competitors across the world , including supply chain disruptions ; inflationary pressures ; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors ; another year of the COVID-19 pandemic ; a worsening climate crisis ; a highly competitive operating environment ; a rapidly changing retail landscape , including the growth in e-commerce ; continued macroeconomic and political volatility , including the deadly conflict in Ukraine ; and an evolving regulatory landscape . To meet the challenges of today – and those of tomorrow – we are driven by an approach called pep+ ( PepsiCo Positive ) . pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business , with sustainability and human capital at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people . pep+ guides how we are working to transform our business operations , from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way , to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet . pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars , bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals under a comprehensive framework : • Positive Agriculture : We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the earth across seven million acres of land , an area approximately equal to our entire agricultural footprint , sustainably source key crops and ingredients , and improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain . In 2022 , we elevated a number of external strategic partnerships and key engagements with this focus , including a partnership with Archer Daniels Midland Company ( ADM ) to scale regenerative agriculture across our shared supply chains , up to 2 million acres ; a research agreement with MIT to develop a more precise measurement of the greenhouse gas impact of regenerative agriculture practices ; a strategic engagement with Corteva focused on agriculture sustainability , new substrates , and affordability in food corn and vegetable oils ; and a joint effort with a start-up called N-Drip to scale advantaged micro irrigation technology that can provide water-saving , crop-enhancing benefits to farmers around the world . 30 Table of Contents • Positive Value Chain : We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to : achieve net-zero emissions by 2040 ; become net water positive by 2030 ; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain . Our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving , using more recycled content in our plastic packaging , and scaling our SodaStream business globally , potentially eliminating the need for more than 200 billion plastic bottles by 2030 . In 2022 , we also announced a new global packaging goal intended to double the percentage of all beverage servings delivered through reusable models from 10 % to 20 % by 2030 . Additionally , we are making progress on our diversity , equity and inclusion journey around the world . And we continue to empower each one of our approximately 315,000 employees to make a positive impact in their communities through our\n",

See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements . 65 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo , Inc. and the affiliates that we control . In addition , we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest , our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources . We do not control these other affiliates , as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50 % or less . Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated . As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions , we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries . As such , our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented . Raw materials , direct labor and plant overhead , as well as purchasing and receiving costs , costs directly related to production planning , inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities , are included in cost of sales . The costs of moving , storing and delivering finished product , including merchandising activities , are included in selling , general and administrative expenses . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenues , expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities . Estimates are used in determining , among other items , sales incentives accruals , tax reserves , share-based compensation , pension and retiree medical accruals , amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite- lived intangible assets , goodwill and other long-lived assets . We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience , as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances , such as current economic conditions , and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change . Additionally , the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate . As future events and their effect can not be determined with precision , actual results could differ significantly from those estimates . Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December , resulting in a 53 reporting week every five or six years , including in our 2022 financial results . While our North America financial results are reported on a weekly calendar basis , substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021 . Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 , all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis . This change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements . The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for 2022 , reflecting the additional week in the fourth quarter : rd Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter United States and Canada 12 weeks 12 weeks 12 weeks 17 weeks International January , February March , April and May June , July and August September , October , November and December Unless otherwise noted , tabular dollars are in millions , except per share amounts .

In addition , we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest , our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources . We do not control these other affiliates , as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50 % or less . Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated . As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions , we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries . As such , our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented . Raw materials , direct labor and plant overhead , as well as purchasing and receiving costs , costs directly related to production planning , inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities , are included in cost of sales . The costs of moving , storing and delivering finished product , including merchandising activities , are included in selling , general and administrative expenses . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenues , expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities . Estimates are used in determining , among other items , sales incentives accruals , tax reserves , share-based compensation , pension and retiree medical accruals , amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite- lived intangible assets , goodwill and other long-lived assets . We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience , as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances , such as current economic conditions , and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change . Additionally , the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate . As future events and their effect can not be determined with precision , actual results could differ significantly from those estimates . Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December , resulting in a 53 reporting week every five or six years , including in our 2022 financial results . While our North America financial results are reported on a weekly calendar basis , substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021 . Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 , all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis . This change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements . The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for 2022 , reflecting the additional week in the fourth quarter : rd Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter United States and Canada 12 weeks 12 weeks 12 weeks 17 weeks International January , February March , April and May June , July and August September , October , November and December Unless otherwise noted , tabular dollars are in millions , except per share amounts .

OUR BUSINESS Executive Overview PepsiCo is a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands , including Lay ’ s , Doritos , Cheetos , Gatorade , Pepsi-Cola , Mountain Dew , Quaker and SodaStream . Through our operations , authorized bottlers , contract manufacturers and other third parties , we make , market , distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods , serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories . As a global company with deep local ties , we faced many of the same challenges in 2022 as our consumers , customers , and competitors across the world , including supply chain disruptions ; inflationary pressures ; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors ; another year of the COVID-19 pandemic ; a worsening climate crisis ; a highly competitive operating environment ; a rapidly changing retail landscape , including the growth in e-commerce ; continued macroeconomic and political volatility , including the deadly conflict in Ukraine ; and an evolving regulatory landscape . To meet the challenges of today – and those of tomorrow – we are driven by an approach called pep+ ( PepsiCo Positive ) . pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business , with sustainability and human capital at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people . pep+ guides how we are working to transform our business operations , from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way , to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet . pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars , bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals under a comprehensive framework : • Positive Agriculture : We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the earth across seven million acres of land , an area approximately equal to our entire agricultural footprint , sustainably source key crops and ingredients , and improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain . In 2022 , we elevated a number of external strategic partnerships and key engagements with this focus , including a partnership with Archer Daniels Midland Company ( ADM ) to scale regenerative agriculture across our shared supply chains , up to 2 million acres ; a research agreement with MIT to develop a more precise measurement of the greenhouse gas impact of regenerative agriculture practices ; a strategic engagement with Corteva focused on agriculture sustainability , new substrates , and affordability in food corn and vegetable oils ; and a joint effort with a start-up called N-Drip to scale advantaged micro irrigation technology that can provide water-saving , crop-enhancing benefits to farmers around the world . 30 Table of Contents • Positive Value Chain : We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to : achieve net-zero emissions by 2040 ; become net water positive by 2030 ; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain . Our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving , using more recycled content in our plastic packaging , and scaling our SodaStream business globally , potentially eliminating the need for more than 200 billion plastic bottles by 2030 . In 2022 , we also announced a new global packaging goal intended to double the percentage of all beverage servings delivered through reusable models from 10 % to 20 % by 2030 . Additionally , we are making progress on our diversity , equity and inclusion journey around the world .

We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted , each adjusted for items affecting comparability , on a constant currency basis , which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period . In order to compute our constant currency results , we multiply or divide , as appropriate , our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide , as appropriate , those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates . We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year . Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation , acquisitions , divestitures and other structural changes , and every five or six years , the impact of the 53 reporting week , including in our 2022 financial results . Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects mergers and acquisitions activity , including the impact in 2021 of an extra month of net revenue for our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods in our AMESA division and Be & Cheery in our APAC division as we aligned the reporting calendars of these acquisitions with those of our divisions , as well as divestitures and other structural changes , including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees . We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year . rd See “ Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth ” in “ Results of Operations – Division Review ” for further information . Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending , plus sales of property , plant and equipment . Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities , we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash . As such , we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities . Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities , including debt repayments , dividends and share repurchases . Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure . See “ Free Cash Flow ” in “ Our Liquidity and Capital Resources ” for further information . Return on invested capital ( ROIC ) and net ROIC , excluding items affecting comparability We define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders ’ equity . Although ROIC is a common financial metric , numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC . Accordingly , the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC . We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns . In addition , we use net ROIC , excluding items affecting comparability , to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our 45 Table of Contents operating results and trends . We define net ROIC , excluding items affecting comparability , as ROIC , adjusted for quarterly average cash , cash equivalents and short-term investments , after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability . We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC , excluding items affecting comparability , provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency . See “ Return on Invested Capital ” in “ Our Liquidity and Capital Resources ” for further information . Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-K are impacted by the following items in each of the following years : Cost of sales Gross profit Selling , general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income ( a ) taxes Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo 2022 34,459 $ ( 3,321 ) $ 3,166 $ 11,512 $ 132 $ 1,727 $ 68 $ 8,910 Reported , GAAP Measure $ 40,576 $ 45,816 $ Items Affecting\n",

See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements . 65 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo , Inc. and the affiliates that we control . In addition , we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest , our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources . We do not control these other affiliates , as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50 % or less . Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated . As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions , we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries . As such , our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented . Raw materials , direct labor and plant overhead , as well as purchasing and receiving costs , costs directly related to production planning , inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities , are included in cost of sales . The costs of moving , storing and delivering finished product , including merchandising activities , are included in selling , general and administrative expenses . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenues , expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities . Estimates are used in determining , among other items , sales incentives accruals , tax reserves , share-based compensation , pension and retiree medical accruals , amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite- lived intangible assets , goodwill and other long-lived assets . We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience , as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances , such as current economic conditions , and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change . Additionally , the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate . As future events and their effect can not be determined with precision , actual results could differ significantly from those estimates . Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December , resulting in a 53 reporting week every five or six years , including in our 2022 financial results . While our North America financial results are reported on a weekly calendar basis , substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021 . Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 , all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis . This change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements . The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for 2022 , reflecting the additional week in the fourth quarter : rd Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter United States and Canada 12 weeks 12 weeks 12 weeks 17 weeks International January , February March , April and May June , July and August September , October , November and December Unless otherwise noted , tabular dollars are in millions , except per share amounts .

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement , whether due to error or fraud , and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects . Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements , whether due to error or fraud , and performing procedures that respond to those risks . Such procedures included examining , on a test basis , evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements . Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management , as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements . Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting , assessing the risk that a material weakness exists , and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk . Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances . We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions . 110 Table of Contents Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company ’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles .

OUR BUSINESS Executive Overview PepsiCo is a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands , including Lay ’ s , Doritos , Cheetos , Gatorade , Pepsi-Cola , Mountain Dew , Quaker and SodaStream . Through our operations , authorized bottlers , contract manufacturers and other third parties , we make , market , distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods , serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories . As a global company with deep local ties , we faced many of the same challenges in 2022 as our consumers , customers , and competitors across the world , including supply chain disruptions ; inflationary pressures ; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors ; another year of the COVID-19 pandemic ; a worsening climate crisis ; a highly competitive operating environment ; a rapidly changing retail landscape , including the growth in e-commerce ; continued macroeconomic and political volatility , including the deadly conflict in Ukraine ; and an evolving regulatory landscape . To meet the challenges of today – and those of tomorrow – we are driven by an approach called pep+ ( PepsiCo Positive ) . pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business , with sustainability and human capital at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people . pep+ guides how we are working to transform our business operations , from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way , to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet . pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars , bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals under a comprehensive framework : • Positive Agriculture : We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the earth across seven million acres of land , an area approximately equal to our entire agricultural footprint , sustainably source key crops and ingredients , and improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain . In 2022 , we elevated a number of external strategic partnerships and key engagements with this focus , including a partnership with Archer Daniels Midland Company ( ADM ) to scale regenerative agriculture across our shared supply chains , up to 2 million acres ; a research agreement with MIT to develop a more precise measurement of the greenhouse gas impact of regenerative agriculture practices ; a strategic engagement with Corteva focused on agriculture sustainability , new substrates , and affordability in food corn and vegetable oils ; and a joint effort with a start-up called N-Drip to scale advantaged micro irrigation technology that can provide water-saving , crop-enhancing benefits to farmers around the world . 30 Table of Contents • Positive Value Chain : We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to : achieve net-zero emissions by 2040 ; become net water positive by 2030 ; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain . Our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving , using more recycled content in our plastic packaging , and scaling our SodaStream business globally , potentially eliminating the need for more than 200 billion plastic bottles by 2030 . In 2022 , we also announced a new global packaging goal intended to double the percentage of all beverage servings delivered through reusable models from 10 % to 20 % by 2030 . Additionally , we are making progress on our diversity , equity and inclusion journey around the world . And we continue to empower each one of our approximately 315,000 employees to make a positive impact in their communities through our\n",

Instead, American Express might discuss revenues less interest expense as a more relevant measure because their primary costs are not associated with manufacturing goods but with financial services like interest expenses, provisions for credit losses, and operating expenses. Thus, in analyzing their 10-K, focus may also need to be placed on net interest income, non-interest revenues, and their operating expenses which play crucial roles in their financial performance analysis.\n",
